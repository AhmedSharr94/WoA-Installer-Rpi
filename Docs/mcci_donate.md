# About MCCI

I'm Terry Moore, CEO of MCCI.

We're the company that created the USB software inside your Raspberry Pi 3.

Among other things, we ported the USB drivers for the RaspberryPi WOA project 😊

## Supporting our work

If the drivers work for you (and I'm sure they did 😉), please consider a donation to [The Things Network New York, Inc](https://thethings.nyc). This is a non-profit 501(c)(3) public charity that MCCI leads in NYC and Ithaca; we are working to deploy community owned, open source, standards-based, free-to-use IoT networks for remote sensing and smart city applications. 

There’s a **“Donate”** link on the TTN NY home page or you can click [this link](https://squareup.com/store/the-things-network-new-york-inc) to go to the donation page.

Note that this doesn’t go to fund MCCI, but rather it goes to fund a cause that MCCI cares a lot about; your contribution will help them (and everyone doing community LoRaWAN networking) in their effort to make IoT a public good.

# The Things Network

The Things Network lets independent municipal leaders like myself (Gale A. Brewer, Manhattan Borough President) walk down a path that was previously unavailable to government, a third way between a municipal build out of a Wide Area Network and a massive franchise agreement with a private corporation. Together with The Things Network, government may now organize in concert with a diverse coalition of partners to create and enhance services at the local community level.

New York can lead by example, showing American technologists that there is more than one way to do an IoT rollout. They don’t need to be done from the top down, with a government franchise and loads of commoditized data.
